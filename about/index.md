A passionate graphic software engineer, my favorite proverb:

> The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.

And I believe this:

> We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.
>
> -- <cite>Bill Gates</cite>


It's never late, just do it. Spend the life on wonderful things.
